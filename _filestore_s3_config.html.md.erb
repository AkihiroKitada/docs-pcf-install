To use an external S3-compatible filestore for PAS file storage, perform the following steps:

1. In the PAS tile, select **File Storage**.
   <%= image_tag("images/external-s3-filestore.png") %>
1. Select the **External S3-Compatible Filestore** option and complete the following fields:
    * Enter the `https://` **URL Endpoint** for your region.
          <br />
          For example, in the **us-west-2** region, enter
          `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/`.
    * Enter the **Access Key** and **Secret Key** of the `pcf-user` you created when configuring AWS for PCF.
    * From the **S3 Signature Version** dropdown, select **V4 Signature**.  For more information about S4 signatures, see [Signing AWS API Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) in the AWS documentation.
    * For **Region**, enter the region in which your S3 buckets are located. `us-west-2` is an example of an acceptable value for this field. 
    * Select **Server-side Encryption** to encrypt the contents of your S3 filestore. This option is only available for AWS S3.
    * (Optional) If you selected **Server-side Encryption**, you can also specify a **KMS Key ID**. PAS uses the KMS key to encrypt files uploaded to the blobstore. If you do not provide a KMS Key ID, PAS uses the default AWS key. For more information, see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMSâ€“Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html).
    * (Optional) Enable **Versioning is enabled for all buckets listed below** for S3 blobstore backup and restore, if your buckets have versioning enabled.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Backup and restore only supports versioned S3-compatible blobstores. For more information about setting up versioning for your blobstore, see <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/external-blobstores.html#enable-versioning">Enable Versioning on Your External Blobstore</a> in the <em>Backup and Restore with External Blobstores</em> topic of the Cloud Foundry documentation.

        <li> Enter the following values for the remaining fields:

          <tr>

            <th>Value</th>

            <td>This S3 bucket stores app buildpacks.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Droplets Bucket Name</strong></td>
            <td><code>pcf-droplets-bucket</code></td>
            <td>This S3 bucket stores app droplets. Pivotal recommends that you use a unique bucket name for droplets, but you can also use the same name as above.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Packages Bucket Name</strong></td>
            <td><code>pcf-packages-bucket</code></td>
            <td>This S3 bucket stores app packages. Pivotal recommends that you use a unique bucket name for packages, but you can also use the same name as above.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Resources Bucket Name</strong></td>
            <td><code>pcf-resources-bucket</code></td>
            <td>This S3 bucket stores app resources. Pivotal recommends that you use a unique bucket name for app resources, but you can also use the same name as above.</td>
