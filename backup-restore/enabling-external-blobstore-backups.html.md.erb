<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to enable external blobstore backups in your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment.

BBR supports both versioned and un-versioned S3-Compatible blobstores. For more information, see [Backup and Restore with External Blobstores](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/external-blobstores.html).

## <a id="unversioned-s3-blobstore"></a> Unversioned S3-compatible Blobstore

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you enable <strong>unversioned</strong> S3-compatible external blobstore backups, you will need to update your runtime configuration when upgrading to PCF v2.2. Remove <code>s3-unversioned-blobstore-backup-restorer</code> from your runtime configuration before upgrading.</p>


### <a id='backup-prepare'></a> Step 1: Enable Backup Prepare Node

To ensure the backup prepare node is deployed on your Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile, see [Enable Backup Prepare Node](backup-pcf-bbr.html#backup-prepare-node) in _Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR_.

### <a id='versioning'></a> Step 2: Setup unversioned S3 Blobstore Buckets

1. Create buckets for your PAS tile. For more information about creating buckets, see [Create S3 Buckets](../pcf-aws-manual-config.html#create-s3) in _Manually Configuring AWS for PCF_.

1. For each bucket created in Step 2.1, create a backup bucket. We recommend that either the backup buckets or copies of them should be in a different region to the live buckets. For more information, see [Enable Backup and Restore of Your Unversioned S3-Compatible Blobstore](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/external-blobstores.html#s3-unversioned)

### <a id='backup-prepare'></a> Step 3: Configure an External Blobstore

To configure an external blobstore for your PAS tile with your S3 buckets, see [External S3 or Ceph Filestore](../pcf-aws-manual-er-config.html#external_s3) in the _Manually Configuring PAS for AWS_.


### <a id='backup-prepare'></a> Step 4: Install the S3 Backups Add-On

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click **PAS** tile.
1. From your browser's address bar, record the PAS deployment name from the URL. The deployment name is prefixed with the letters `cf`. For example, in `http://pcf.EXAMPLE-HOST.com/products/cf-3247176589a379f246d1`, the PAS deployment name is `cf-3247176589a379f246d1`. The PAS deployment name value is used to update the runtime config in a later step.
1. Select the **Credentials** tab.
1. Locate **Director Credentials** and click **Link to Credentials** to retrieve your Director credentials. Record your **Director Credentials**. The **Director Credentials** are used to update the runtime config in a later step.
1. Select the **Status** tab.
1. Record the BOSH Director IP address. The BOSH Director IP address value is used to update the runtime config in a later step.
1. Go to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/) and download **External Blobstore Support for BOSH Backup and Restore**.
1. Run the following command to copy the release archive to your Ops Manager instance. For more information on obtaining your private key, see [Step 4: Check your BOSH Director
](backup-pcf-bbr.html#check-director) in _Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR_.
  <pre class="terminal">$ scp -i PATH\_TO\_PRIVATE\_KEY
    backup-and-restore-sdk-addon-SEMVER.tar.gz ubuntu@YOUR\_OPS\_MANAGER\_VM\_IP:~</pre>
1. Run the following command to SSH into the Ops Manager instance.
  <pre class="terminal">$ ssh -i PATH\_TO\_PRIVATE\_KEY ubuntu@YOUR\_OPS\_MANAGER\_VM\_IP</pre>
1. In the Ops Manager VM, run the following command to log in to your BOSH Director. When prompted, enter your BOSH Director credentials.
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e BOSH\_DIRECTOR\_IP --ca-cert
    /FILE-PATH-ROOT-TO-CA-CERTIFICATE login</pre>
1. Run the following command to upload the External Blobstore Support for BOSH Backup and Restore release that you previously downloaded from Pivotal Network.
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e BOSH\_DIRECTOR\_IP --ca-cert
   /FILE-PATH-ROOT-TO-CA-CERTIFICATE upload-release backup-and-restore-sdk-addon-SEMVER.tar.gz</pre>
1. Run the following command to confirm that the release upload has succeeded.
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e BOSH\_DIRECTOR\_IP --ca-cert
   /FILE-PATH-ROOT-TO-CA-CERTIFICATE releases</pre>
  You should see a `backup-and-restore-sdk-addon-SEMVER` entry.
1. Run the following command to download your current runtime config and save it as `runtime-config.yml`.
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e BOSH\_DIRECTOR\_IP --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate runtime-config > runtime-config.yml</pre>
  If you receive an error about a missing runtime config, create an empty file and save it as `runtime-config.yml`.
1. Append the below to the `releases` section of your `runtime-config.yml`.
  <pre>
  releases:
  <!-- Append the below to the list of releases: -->
  \- name: backup-and-restore-sdk-addon
      version: &lt;the-release-version&gt;
  </pre>

1. Append the appropriate configuration to the `addons` section of your `runtime-config.yml`.
</br>
</br>
 Replace the bracketed placeholders in the `droplets`, `packages`, and `buildpacks` sections with the values you previously created in [Step 2: Setup S3 Blobstore Buckets](../pcf-aws-manual-config.html#create-s3).
</br>
</br>
 Replace the bracketed information in the `include` section with the PAS Deployment name you recorded earlier.

1. Navigate to your **Ops Manager Installation Dashboard**. Click **Apply Changes**

## <a id="azure"></a> Azure Blobstores
### <a id="configuring-azure-blobstore"></a> Configuring your Azure blobstore for backups

In order to perform backups of your Azure blobstore, you will need to apply the following configurations:

1. Enable soft deletes on your blob storage account. For more information, see [Enable soft delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-soft-delete#quickstart)

1. (Optional) Pivotal recommends you configure a retention policy to delete soft deleted objects after a period of time. Configuring this policy saves storage space and cost. For more information, see [Enable soft delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-soft-delete#quickstart)
